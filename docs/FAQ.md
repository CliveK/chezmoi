## How can I quickly check for problems with chezmoi on my machine?

Run:

    chezmoi doctor

Anything `ok` is fine, anything `warning` is only a problem if you want to use
the related feature, and anything `error` indicates a definite problem.

## What are the consequences of "bare" modifications to the target files? If my `.zshrc` is managed by chezmoi and I edit `~/.zshrc` without using `chezmoi edit`, what happens?

chezmoi will overwrite the file the next time you run `chezmoi apply`. Until you
run `chezmoi apply` your modified `~/.zshrc` will remain in place.

## How can I tell what dotfiles in my home directory aren't managed by chezmoi? Is there an easy way to have chezmoi manage a subset of them?

`chezmoi unmanaged` will list everything not managed by chezmoi. You can add
entire directories with `chezmoi add -r`.

## How can I tell what dotfiles in my home directory are currently managed by chezmoi?

`chezmoi managed` will list everything managed by chezmoi.

## If there's a mechanism in place for the above, is there also a way to tell chezmoi to ignore specific files or groups of files (e.g. by directory name or by glob)?

By default, chezmoi ignores everything that you haven't explicitly `chezmoi
add`'ed. If have files in your source directory that you don't want added to
your destination directory when you run `chezmoi apply` add their names to a
file called `.chezmoiignore` in the source state.

Patterns are supported, and the you can change what's ignored from machine to
machine. The full usage and syntax is described in the [reference
manual](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/blob/master/docs/REFERENCE.md#chezmoiignore).

## If the target already exists, but is "behind" the source, can chezmoi be configured to preserve the target version before replacing it with one derived from the source?

Yes. Run `chezmoi add` will update the source state with the target. To see
diffs of what would change, without actually changing anything, use `chezmoi
diff`.

## Once I've made a change to the source directory, how do I commit it?

You have several options:

* `chezmoi cd` opens a shell in the source directory, where you can run your
  usual version control commands, like `git add` and `git commit`.

* `chezmoi git` *arguments* and `chezmoi hg` *arguments* run `git` and `hg`
  respectively in the source directory with *arguments*, for example `chezmoi
  git add .`. If you're passing any flags, you'll need to use `--` to prevent
  chezmoi from consuming them, for example `chezmoi git -- commit -m "Update
  dotfiles"`.

* `chezmoi source` *arguments* runs your configured version control system in
  your source directory. It works in the same was as the `chezmoi git` and
  `chezmoi hg` commands.

* chezmoi has experimental support for automatically committing and pushing
  changes to your git repo whenever you run a command. See the "Explore
  experimental features" section in the how-to for more information.

## How do I only run a script when a file has changed?

A common example of this is that you're using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and
have `.Brewfile` listing all the packages that you want installed and only want
to run `brew bundle --global` when the contents of `.Brewfile` changes.

chezmoi has two types of scripts: scripts that run every time, and scripts that
only run when their contents change. chezmoi does not have a mechanism to run a
script when an arbitrary file has changed, but there are some ways to achieve
the desired behavior:

1. Have the script create `.Brewfile` instead of chezmoi, e.g. in your
   `run_once_install-packages`:

   ```sh
   #!/bin/sh

   cat > $HOME/.Brewfile <<EOF
   brew "imagemagick"
   brew "openssl"
   EOF

   brew bundle --global
   ```

2. Don't use `.Brewfile`, and instead install the packages explicitly in
   `run_once_install-packages`:

   ```sh
   #!/bin/sh

   brew install imagemagick || true
   brew install openssl || true
   ```

   The `|| true` is necessary because `brew install` exits with failure if the
   package is already installed.

3. Use a script that runs every time (not just once) and rely on `brew bundle
   --global` being idempotent.

4. Use a script that runs every time, records a checksum of `.Brewfile` in
   another file, and only runs `brew bundle --global` if the checksum has
   changed, and updates the recorded checksum after.

## I've made changes to both the destination state and the source state that I want to keep. How can I keep them both?

`chezmoi merge` will open a merge tool to resolve differences between the source
state, target state, and destination state. Copy the changes you want to keep in
to the source state.

## Why does chezmoi convert all my template variables to lowercase?

This is due to a feature in
[`github.com/spf13/viper`](https://github.com/spf13/viper), the library that
chezmoi uses to read its configuration file. For more information see [this
GitHub issue issue](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/issues/463).

## chezmoi makes `~/.ssh/config` group writeable. How do I stop this?

By default, chezmoi uses your system's umask when creating files. On most
systems the default umask is `0o22` but some systems use `0o02`, which means
that files and directories are group writeable by default.

You can override this for chezmoi by setting the `umask` configuration variable
in your configuration file, for example:

    umask = 0o22

Note that this will apply to all files and directories that chezmoi manages and
will ensure that none of them are group writeable. It is not currently possible
to control group writability for individual files or directories. Please [open
an issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=02_feature_request.md&title=)
if you need this.

## chezmoi's source file naming system cannot handle all possible filenames

This is correct. Certain target filenames, for example `~/dot_example`, are
incompatible with chezmoi's
[attributes](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/blob/master/docs/REFERENCE.md#source-state-attributes)
used in the source state.

This is a deliberate, practical compromise. Target state metadata (private,
encrypted, etc.) need to be stored for each file. Using the source state
filename for this means that the contents of the file are untouched, there is no
need to maintain the metadata in a separate file, is independent of the
underlying filesystem and version control system, and unambiguously associates
the metadata with a single file.

In practice, dotfile filenames are unlikely to conflict with chezmoi's
attributes. If this does cause a genuine problem for you, please [open an
issue on GitHub](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/issues/new/choose).

## gpg encryption fails. What could be wrong?

The `gpg.recipient` key should be ultimately trusted, otherwise encryption will
fail because gpg will prompt for input, which chezmoi does not handle. You can
check the trust level by running:

    gpg --export-ownertrust

The trust level for the recipient's key should be `6`. If it is not, you can
change the trust level by running:

    gpg --edit-key $recipient

Enter `trust` at the prompt and chose `5 = I trust ultimately`.

## I'm getting errors trying to build chezmoi from source

chezmoi requires Go version 1.13 or later and Go modules enabled. You can check
the version of Go with:

    go version

Enable Go modules by setting `GO111MODULE=on` when running `go get`:

    GO111MODULE=on go get -u github.com/twpayne/chezmoi

Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## What inspired chezmoi?

chezmoi was inspired by [Puppet](https://puppet.com/), but created because
Puppet is a slow overkill for managing your personal configuration files. The
focus of chezmoi will always be personal home directory management. If your
needs grow beyond that, switch to a whole system configuration management tool.

## Can I use chezmoi outside my home directory?

chezmoi, by default, operates on your home directory, but this can be overridden
with the `--destination` command line flag or by specifying `destDir` in your config
file. In theory, you could use chezmoi to manage any aspect of your filesystem.
That said, although you can do this, you probably shouldn't. Existing
configuration management tools like [Puppet](https://puppet.com/),
[Chef](https://www.chef.io/chef/), [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), and
[Salt](https://www.saltstack.com/) are much better suited to whole system
configuration management.

## Where does the name "chezmoi" come from?

"chezmoi" splits to "chez moi" and pronounced /ʃeɪ mwa/ (shay-moi) meaning "at
my house" in French. It's seven letters long, which is an appropriate length for
a command that is only run occasionally.

## What other questions have been asked about chezmoi?
